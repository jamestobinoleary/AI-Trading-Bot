# Step 4: Second-Order Effects

step_id: "04_second_order"
description: "Identify cascading, non-obvious consequences"

prompt: |
  Beyond direct policy impact, identify second-order and cascading effects:
  
  Examples:
  - Rate hikes → higher debt servicing → fiscal stress → spending cuts
  - QE → financial conditions easing → asset bubbles → wealth inequality
  - Supply shock → inflation → wage pressure → profit squeeze
  - Credit tightening → small biz stress → labor market softness
  
  For each chain, describe:
  1. The trigger (from today's events)
  2. The chain of causality (A → B → C)
  3. Magnitude & timing
  4. Sectors / regions most affected
  5. Probability of materializing
