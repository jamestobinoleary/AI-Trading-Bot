step_id: "02_macro_regime"
description: "Classify current macro regime based on filtered events"

prompt: |
  Based on today's filtered events, classify the current macro regime:
  
  Regime types:
  - INFLATIONARY: Rising inflation, policy tightening, stagflation risk
  - DISINFLATIONARY: Easing pressure, demand slowdown, policy accommodation
  - STRUCTURAL_SHIFT: Regime change (e.g., productivity shock, demographic shift)
  - EQUILIBRIUM: Stable, no major pressure
  - CRISIS: Systemic stress, liquidity concerns
  
  For each:
  - Describe key drivers (from today's events)
  - Assign confidence (0-100%)
  - List leading/lagging indicators to watch
