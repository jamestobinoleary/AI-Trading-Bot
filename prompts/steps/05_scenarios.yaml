# Step 5: Forward Scenarios (Bull / Base / Bear)

step_id: "05_scenarios"
description: "Construct coherent forward scenarios over 6-12 months"

prompt: |
  Construct three forward scenarios (6–12 month horizon):
  
  BULL SCENARIO
  - Policy succeeds in its intent
  - No major unexpected shocks
  - Positive feedback loops (confidence → spending → growth)
  - Conditions that would make this likely
  
  BASE SCENARIO
  - Moderate progress with friction
  - Some headwinds emerge
  - Mixed signals, delayed transmission
  - Most likely given current structure
  
  BEAR SCENARIO
  - Policy backfires or conditions worsen
  - Negative feedback loops
  - Tail risks materialize
  - Specific triggers that could cause this
  
  For each:
  - Describe macro outcome (growth, inflation, employment)
  - Assign probability (must sum to ~100%)
  - Key milestones / decision points
