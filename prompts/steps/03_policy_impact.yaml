# Step 3: Policy Impact Analysis

step_id: "03_policy_impact"
description: "Analyze direct & indirect effects of policy announcements"

prompt: |
  Given the macro regime and today's policy announcements, assess:
  
  1. DIRECT IMPACT
     - What does policy do immediately? (rate cut → lower borrowing, etc.)
     - Magnitude & timing
     - Who benefits / loses?
  
  2. TRANSMISSION CHANNELS
     - How does policy reach the real economy?
     - Financial conditions → real rates → investment/consumption
     - Credit creation → money supply
     - Confidence/expectations shifts
  
  3. RISKS & SIDE EFFECTS
     - Unintended consequences
     - Lag & overshoots
     - Fiscal dominance, debt dynamics, EM spillovers
